Loops

- Sometimes, you need to perform code on each item in a list. This si called iteration, and it can be accomplished with a while loop and a counter variable.

#Loops

words = ["hello","world","spam","eggs"]
counter = 0
max_index = len(words) - 1

while counter <= max_index:
  word = words[counter]
  print(word+"!")
  counter = counter + 1
  
>>>
hello!
world!
spam!
eggs!
>>>

for Loop

- Iterating through a list using a while loop requries quite a lot of code, so Python provides the for loop as a shortcut that accomplishes the same thing.
  The same code from the previous example can be written with a for loop, as follows:
- The for loop is commonly used to repeat some code a certain number of times. This is done by combing for loops with range objects.

#for Loop

words=["Hello","world","spam","eggs"]
for word in words:
  print(word+"!")

>>>
Hello!
world!
spam!
eggs!
>>>

letters = ['a','b','c']
for I in letters:
print(I)

for I in range(5):
  print("Hello!")
  
>>>
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
>>>
