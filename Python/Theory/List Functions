List Functions

- Another way of altering lists is using the append method. This adds an item to the end of an existing list.
- To get the number of items in a list, you can use the len function.
- The insert method is similar to append, except that it allows you to insert a new item at any position in the list, as opposed to just at the end.
- The index method finds the first occurrence of a list item and returns its index. If the item isn't in the list, it raises a ValueError.

#List Functions
nums = [1,2,3]
nums.append(4)
print(nums)

>>>
[1,2,3,4]
>>>

nums = [1,3,5,2,4]
print(len(nums))

>>>
5
>>>

words = ["Python","fun"]
index = 1
words.insert(index,"is")
print(words)

>>>
["Python","is","fun"]
>>>

letters = ['p','q','r','s','p','u']
print(letters.index('r'))
print(letters.index('p'))
print(letters.index('z'))

>>>
2
0
ValueError: 'z' is not on list
>>>
