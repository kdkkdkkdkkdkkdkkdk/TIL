Range

- The range function creates a sequential list of numbers. The code below generates a list containing all of the integers, up to 10.
- If range is called with on argument, it prodeces an object with values from 0 to that argument. If it is called with two arguments, it produces values from the first to the second.
- range can have a third argument, which determines the interval of the sequence produced. This third argument must be an integer.

#Range

numbers = list(range(10))
print(numbers)

>>>
[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
>>>

numbers = list(range(3,8))
print(numbers)

print(range(20))==(print(range(0,20))

>>>
[3,4,5,6,7]

True
>>>

numbers = list(range(5,20,2))
print(numbers)

>>>
[5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19]
